# Specify Selection Criteria
_As an analyzer I want to specify selection criteria so I can refer regions of phase space in an unambiguous way_

## Assumptions
1. Can be translated and applied to data
2. Theorist could in principle make a prediction
3. Can overlap or be “orthogonal” (disjoint is better term, orthogonal is jargon)
4. Regions are labeled
5. Selection criteria is self contained
6. Selection criteria is human readable
7. The underlying data model is implicit in the selection criteria

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Specification is well-documented - Eg. equivalent of JSON schema validation
2. There is a python parser library
3. There are unit tests of the library
4. There is a CI environment

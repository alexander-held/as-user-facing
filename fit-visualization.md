# Fit visualization

## General acceptance criteria
- The visualization can be adjusted to conform to formatting rules required by the users:
    - logos (e.g. of an experiment) can be included,
    - additional text can be added (e.g. center of mass energy and integrated luminosity for an LHC result).
- Colors used in the visualization avoid the common pitfalls listed in [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/color-pitfalls.html), and are colorblind friendly as verified via a [cvd simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).
- All relevant information about the figure is retained when viewing it in grayscale.

# User-facing interfaces to analysis systems

## User Stories
As a community, we are creating a set of user stories to define the end-to-end
physics process. These stories are articulated from the user's point of view
and describes how they derive value from the operation.

Each user story is further defined by assumptions that underly them as well as
a set of acceptance criteria which could be applied to agree that the story has
been implemented.

## Physics Process Phases
- *Exploratory*: quick plots, could require interacting with a subset of the
full sample, generally requires low-latency (aka “human attention span”
turnaround) Could also include optimization as a component (which same
requirements)
- *Production*: organized workflow that runs semi-automatically
- *Reactionary*: also quick plots, but must be full dataset and embellishments
on existing plots (“just like this but with a cut on X”); low-latency is less
important, as it’s not tied to human attention span timescales but reviewer
interaction rate (days)
- *Transfer*: long-term preservation and new student on an ongoing analysis


## Next steps
Once the community has collected and agreed a complete set of user stories we
will map our existing products against these stories to unambiguously identify
gaps, overlaps, and integration opportunities.
